# password-manager-python

## An application for managing passwords using tkinter.

For many websites the password rules are just really terrible and complicated.

So making a password that matches all the requirements might be so difficualt to do. Even if such a password is created, then it might be too difficult to remember.

Here in this project a password manager application is developed, that will store and generate passwords.

For eg: if you want to create a password for any website, then enter the name of the website, so that you know for which website the password is for.

Your email or username will be already prepopulated in the password manager.

Then you can either type in the password you want or click generate password button.

When you click generate password button, it will generate a very long password with all of the required numbers, symbols and letters. 

Finally, when you can click the add button, you will get a pop up message asking you if the given credentials are ok.

If you click "ok" then that data will be added to a text file which can keep locally in your computer, so that at later time, when you forget the password for any sites, you can refer this text file. 

There is also some basic validation included.

For eg. if you leave one of the fileds empty and you click add, then you will get a pop up that tells you, please don't leave any of the fields empty.

This will automatically copy the generated password in the clipboard, so that the you can actually immediately use it by pasting it.

You can also search for the password and email of any website that you signed up.


Since this app keeps everything locally on your computer, this is alot safer than using a third-party service for password management, which is internet based service.
